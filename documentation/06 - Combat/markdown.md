## Combat Round

## Character Turn
A character's turn follows the following steps:
1. Recover one stamina.
2. Gain a number of Action Points based on their character type trait (3 for adventurer).
3. Take any number of actions provided the character has action points remaining.
4. Remove any unspent action points.
5. Move to the next character's turn in initiative order.

## Actions
### Multi-Action Penalty
Many actions taken in combat are complicated, requiring a skill check to determine if, and by how much, the action succeeds. Due to the complexity of these actions the character suffers one penalty die to every skill check made in a turn for every skill check they have already made that turn, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the action's description. Similarly, a character making multiple skill checks outside of their turn suffers one penalty die to every skill check for each skill check they have made since the end of their last turn.
