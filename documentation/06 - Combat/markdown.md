## Combat Round

## Character Turn
A character's turn follows the following steps:
1. Recover one stamina.
2. Gain 3 Action Points.
3. Take any number of actions provided the character has action points remaining.
4. Remove any unspent action points.
5. Move to the next character's turn in initiative order.

## Actions
### Multi-Attack Penalty
Some actions, or reactions, are attack (re)actions, these require either a melee attack, ranged attack, or magical attack skill check; each time a character performs one of these skill checks they increase their multi-attack penalty by one, unless the action they took specifically states otherwise. Each attack skill check a character makes gains a level of disadvantage equal to their multi-attack penalty. A character's multi attack penalty is reset to zero at the beginning and end of each of their turns.

### Melee Actions
#### Basic Attack
**Action Points:** 1
**Stamina Cost:** 0
Make an attack with a readied melee weapon. The character makes a *melee attack skill check* and applies the results.
#### Bash
**Action Points:** 1
**Stamina Cost:** 1
**Requires:** Weapon/attack with the *Bash* keyword that deals concussive damage.
Make an attack with a readied melee weapon. The character makes a *melee attack skill check* and applies the results. The skill check gains a level of disadvantage if the character does not have at least one rank in the *bash secondary skill (melee combat)*. If the attack hits the target back one hex, and the first X additional successes must be spent to knock the target prone where X is equal to one plus the target's *size*, if positive, plus the targets *body* and minus the attacker's rank in the *bash secondary skill (melee combat)*. If the character succeeds in knocking their target back one hex they may advance one hex as part of this action.
#### Bull Rush
**Action Points:** 1
**Stamina Cost:** 1
**Requires:** *body* of at least +1.
Make a brawling attack or attack with an equipped shield attempting to push the target back. The character makes a *melee attack skill check* and applies the results. The skill check uses *body* instead of *reflexes* as the primary attribute, gains one level of disadvantage if the character does not have at least one rank in the *bull rush secondary skill (melee combat)* and the target's *melee defense bonus* does not benefit from any shield(s) they may be wielding. On a hit the target is pushed back one hex per rank the character has in the bull rush secondary skill (melee combat), and unless the target is pinned against a wall or other hard surface the first X additional successes must be spent to increase the distance the target is pushed by one hex where X is equal to the sum of the target's *body* and *size* (minimum one) after the first X successes have been spent each additional success increases the distance pushed by one hex; if the target is pushed into a wall or other hard surface increase the damage inflicted by the attack by the number of hexes the target was pushed and any remaining successes can be spent to increase the damage by two. The attacker moves with the target as they are pushed but may choose to stop a number of hexes, equal to their *body* attribute, short; doing so prevents them from using additional successes for extra damage.
#### Brawling
**Action Points:** 1
**Stamina Cost:** 0
Make an attack with the character's fists, feet, or natural weapon. The character makes a *melee attack skill check* and applies the results, on a complete success add a number of additional successes to the result equal to the character's rank in the *brawling secondary skill (melee combat)*.
#### Disarm
**Action Points:** 1
**Stamina Cost:** 1
Make a brawling attack or an attack with a readied melee weapon with the aim to disarm the target rather than harm them. The character makes a *melee attack skill check* and applies the results. The skill check gains a level of disadvantage if the character doesn't have at least one rank in the *disarm secondary skill (melee combat)*, an additional level of disadvantage if the character is unarmed unless they have at least two ranks in the *disarm secondary skill (melee combat)*, and an additional level of disadvantage if the target is wielding their weapon in two hands. If the attack was performed unarmed and the skill check failed the attacker suffers the effects of being hit by the weapon they were attempting to disarm as if the attacker had a *body* of 0. If the skill check succeeds instead of inflicting damage the target's weapon (attacker's choice if wielding more than one) is knocked to the ground at their feet, each additional success may be used to knock the disarmed weapon an additional hex away from the target and 5 minus the character's rank in the *disarm secondary skill (melee combat)* additional successes may be spent to allow a character in the same hex as the weapon to ready it provided they have a free hand.

Ignore any additional successes on this skill check in excess of the character's rank in the *off-hand attack secondary skill (melee combat)*. If the character has taken a different melee action already turn, the first time they take this action they may ignore all levels of disadvantage generated for having already taken melee actions this turn.
