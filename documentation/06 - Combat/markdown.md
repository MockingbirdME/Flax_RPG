## Combat Round

## Character Turn
A character's turn follows the following steps:
1. Recover one stamina.
2. Gain 3 Action Points.
3. Take any number of actions provided the character has action points remaining.
4. Remove any unspent action points.
5. Move to the next character's turn in initiative order.

## Actions
### Multi-Attack Penalty
Some actions, or reactions, are attack (re)actions, these require either a melee attack, ranged attack, or magical attack skill check; each time a character performs one of these skill checks they increase their multi-attack penalty by one, unless the action they took specifically states otherwise. Each attack skill check a character makes gains a number of penalty dice equal to their multi-attack penalty. A character's multi attack penalty is reset to zero at the beginning and end of each of their turns.
