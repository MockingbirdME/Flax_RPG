## Suffering Damage
When a character suffers damage from some attack or effect follow the steps below.
1. Determine the type of damage being inflicted.
2. If damage type is penetrating and the total amount of damage is less than the character's *armor value* change the damage type to concussive.
3. Reduce the damage by the character's *resistance* for the specific type of damage, to a minimum of one.
4. If the character has the *weakness* trait for the damage type double the remaining damage.
5. Reduce the targets stamina by the amount of damage inflicted, if this damage reduces the character to 0 stamina inflict one wound, reset the character's stamina to its current max, and inflict the remaining damage, repeat until the damage has all been inflicted or the target is defeated (killed, destroyed, sundered, etc.).

## Effects of being wounded
* **Lightly Wounded -** each time a character suffers a wound reduce their defense and max stamina by one until that wound is healed.
* **Wounded -** if a character has suffered at least half their *max wounds* they gain one penalty die to each of their skill checks.
* **Badly Wounded -** if a character has suffered a number of wounds equal to their *max wounds* they suffer two penalty dice to each of their skill checks.
* **Dying -** if a character has suffered more wounds than their *max wounds* they can not take actions or perform skill checks and they will soon die without medical attention.

## Permanent Injuries

## Dying

## Recovering from Injuries
recovering one wound takes three times the total number of wounds the character has - character's body days while they are resting and twice as long if they are being active (minimum one); medical attention and magic may reduce this time.
ex. a character with +0 body and three wounds takes 18 days to fully recover (9 for the first wound while the character has three wounds, 6 for the second, and 3 for the last) while a character with a +2 body takes only 12 days (7 for the first wound, 4 for the second, and only 1 for the last).
