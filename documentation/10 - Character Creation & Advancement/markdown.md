   2. Optionally increase one attribute to +1 and either reduce two others to -1 or one other to -2.
4. Apply strain attribute modifiers and traits.
5. Gain a _character type_ trait as determined by your GM (most likely _Adventurer_) and apply its effects.

## Beyond Starting Character Level

Character's gain new and better skills, traits, even attributes as they progress through a campaign. At various milestones of play characters should gain levels, granting them additional traits; depending on the speed your game is looking to go a character may get one or more levels as often as every session or as rarely as at the end of each major chapter. Each time a character gains a new trait they may also choose an old trait to reassign, losing the previous benefit and gaining a new one; they may not reassign a trait that is a requirement for another trait they still possess however.
