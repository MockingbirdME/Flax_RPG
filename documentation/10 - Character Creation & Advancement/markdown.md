## Beyond Starting Character Level
Character's gain new and better skills, traits, even attributes as they progress through a campaign. At various milestones of play characters should gain levels, granting them additional traits; depending on the speed your game is looking to go a new character may get a level as often as every session or as rarely as at the end of each major chapter.
