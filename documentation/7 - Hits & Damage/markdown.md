## Suffering Damage
When a character suffers damage from some attack or effect follow the steps below.
1. Determine the type of damage being inflicted.
2. If damage type is penetrating and the total amount of damage is less than the character's *armor value* change the damage type to concussive.
3. Reduce the damage by the character's *resistance* for the specific type of damage.
4. If the character has the *weakness* trait for the damage type double the remaining damage.
4. If the remaining damage is greater than zero reduce and equal to or less than the character's *toughness*, reduce the damage to one.
5. Inflict the a number of wounds to the character equal to the remaining damage.

## Suffering From Damage
A character who has taken damage may suffers from the most penalizing of follow conditions that they qualify for.
* **Stunned -** if the character has suffered two or more wounds from one instance of damage since their last turn they suffer a minus one penalty to each of their skill checks.
* **Lightly Wounded -** if the character has suffered at least as many wounds as their *toughness* they suffer a minus one penalty to all of their skill checks.
* **Wounded -** if a character has suffered at least half their *max wounds* they gain disadvantage to each of their skill checks.
* **Badly Wounded -** if a character has suffered a number of wounds equal to their *max wounds* they suffer two levels of disadvantage to each of their skill checks.
* **Dying -** if a character has suffered more wounds than their *max wounds* they can not take actions or perform skill checks and they will soon die without medical attention.
