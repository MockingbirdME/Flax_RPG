# The Nows

In the first of Nows existed Zennies, The Stasis, who was also The Nothing. The Stasis, so distraught by their own failings willed into being Projo, The Seer so that they may have a companion. In the moment The Seer manifested he split into two. Projo's compliment called Yeast, The Rememberer, was like her twin also The Seer.

Zennies, The Static One, found himself caught always between The Twins such that he would gaze upon Projo when looking forward and upon Yeast when looking behind. Zennies, The Void, and The Seers became the First Trinity and the Nows faded and the Hours began. 

# The Hours

In the first Hour Projo, He who Envisions, spoke with his twin of their parent, The Nothing's, many lackings. Yeast's parent, He who Exists, upon hearing his children speak became unhappy with his formlessness. It was thus, in the first Hour, that Zennies performed his second act of will and The Nothing fragmented becoming many. These many included Solm, She who Illuminates, Flax, She of Substance, and Kin, The Forces. With this act of will Zennies's, who was now called The Scattered, brought an end to the first Hour. 

In the second Hour after the birth of The Twins, Flax, The Great Nurturer, who was then lonely asked of her younger sibling to bring her closer to her older sister, who was then the favorite of Zennies, Parent of All. From this event hence all daughters of Flax would seek to be near the daughters of Solm, though they would find themselves in constant competition with Zennies, The Jealous, for the attention of Solm and her kind for The Scattered too seeks to bask in their attention. 

To mark the beginning of the third Hour jealous Zennies, Parent of All and Nothing, created another child whom he cast upon his middle daughter to blanket her from the rays of Solm's affection. This child who is called The Cleanser did as his parent bade him, blocking from Flax, The Living One, all the warmth Solm sent her. Upon seeing this Kin, Mover of all things, who had no love for their parent, The Stasis, but much for their sisters created a daughter of their own whom she called Shiver, The Northern Wind. Kin sent Shiver to Flax and bade her destroy The Cleanser or otherwise remove him from Flax. Try though she might Shiver, The Relentless, could not completely separate her uncle, Clurses, from Flax but instead scattered him and blew him about so that sometimes Flax would receive Solm's warmth and affection and other times Clurses would come between the sisters. 

Despite the aid she received from Shiver, sometimes called Breeze, her niece, Flax's anger continued to grow as she felt that her parent, who was once Nothing, had shunned their battle for Solm's attention. This anger built through the third Hour and as the fourth was dawning Flax erupted no longer able to contain her anger, an act that would split and blemish her once smooth face creating deep wounds that smoked from her anger. Clurses understanding the part he played in Flax's anger and holding himself accountable for her pain began to weep. He wept for the entirety of the Hour, where his tears landed Flax began to heal. It is unknown if was Clurses's tears or Flax's healing that gave birth to Levith and the twins Seva and Yajgul but it was at this time the three of them appeared and began to populate life on Flax. Levith created creatures to swim in the tears that filled Flax's, no healed, wounds, while Seva and Yajgul brought life to those parts of her face that yet remained above water. Even Barren Shiver was so moved by the events of the fourth Hour that she allowed life into her domain. 

In the fifth Hour those who resided upon Flax Shiver, Levith, Seva, and Yajgul, as well as Clurses who lived above her became known as The Dwellers and they began to multiply until they were many. This pleased Flax, and eased the tension between her and her parent. It was then as the fifth Hour was ending that Projo, Who Sees, and his twin, Who Remembers, saw all that had passed since they came from The Nothing and saw too that the Hours were at an end. The Twins brought into being a third Seer to complete themselves, they called this one Bard, The Keeper, and with her appearance the Hours came to and end and the first Day began.
