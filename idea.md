Damage system + defense/stamina/wound refactor:

Defense - resource that is lowered by number of wounds the character has and by distracting attacks.

Stamina - starts at 10, instead of adding to it increase regen with stamina/endurance skills.

Fatigue - character can take a point of fatigue to regain all stamina, happens automatically if they reduce themselves to zero stamina. Fatigue reduces a character's max stamina.
recovering a fatigue takes two hours of rest, recovers twice as fast while sleeping.

Wounds - starts at ~5 effects TBD
each wound taken reduces defense and stamina by one.
character with half or less of their wounds left gains a penalty die to all skill checks.
character with no wounds left gains additional penalty die to all skill checks.
character with no wounds left that takes additional wound dies.
recovering one wound takes three times the total number of wounds the character has - character's body days while they are resting and twice as long if they are being active (minimum one); medical attention and magic may reduce this time.
ex. a character with +0 body and three wounds takes 18 days to fully recover (9 for the first wound while the character has three wounds, 6 for the second, and 3 for the last) while a character with a +2 body takes only 12 days (7 for the first wound, 4 for the second, and only 1 for the last).





Damage - damage reduces stamina, if stamina hits zero inflicts a wound and refreshes stamina.

weapon damage should be ~3-6 + twice body stat + amount attack exceeded defense.
