Damage system + defense/stamina/wound refactor:

Defense - resource that is lowered by number of wounds the character has and by distracting attacks.

    Starting defense should range from 8-16
    Base Defense - 8 + ref + per + size (possible range of 7 - 11 for size zero characters)


Magic - Have a focus check that's required when a character takes damage from an outside source or wounds from any source. Consider something like difficulty 11 or the total amount of damage inflicted, or 5 plus damage inflicted, or something like that, where a success lets the caster choose one ongoing effect (with a duration success in it) to keep going, additional successes allow an extra success each to be up-kept.

















Arcane theme groupings

New ones to add:
Transference
Travel
Knowledge
Metal (Maybe update steel to be a more specialized version of this)


Idea: Have overlapping groups for various concepts
ex.
Healing, Nurture, Birth themes all have some healing concepts but with various focuses.
