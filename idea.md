Damage system + defense/stamina/wound refactor:

Defense - resource that is lowered by number of wounds the character has and by distracting attacks.

    Starting defense should range from 8-16
    Base Defense - 8 + ref + per + size (possible range of 7 - 11 for size zero characters)

    Equipment specific bonuses (static or action dependent?)
        - parry: vs melee only (activated by defensive stance action)
        - shield: vs melee and range (always active)



Fatigue - character can take a point of fatigue to regain all stamina, happens automatically if they reduce themselves to zero stamina. Fatigue reduces a character's max stamina.
recovering a fatigue takes two hours of rest, recovers twice as fast while sleeping.


Armor
  - Armor value: compared to APV





  Magic - Have a focus check that's required when a character takes damage from an outside source or wounds from any source. Consider something like difficulty 11 or the total amount of damage inflicted, or 5 plus damage inflicted, or something like that, where a success lets the caster choose one ongoing effect (with a duration success in it) to keep going, additional successes allow an extra success each to be up-kept.


Action refactor:

Provide less specific options but limit to one each so we can build in limits and penalties individually.
