Damage system + defense/stamina/wound refactor:

Defense - resource that is lowered by number of wounds the character has and by distracting attacks.

    Starting defense should range from 8-16
    Base Defense - 8 + ref + per + size (possible range of 7 - 11 for size zero characters)


Magic - Have a focus check that's required when a character takes damage from an outside source or wounds from any source. Consider something like difficulty 11 or the total amount of damage inflicted, or 5 plus damage inflicted, or something like that, where a success lets the caster choose one ongoing effect (with a duration success in it) to keep going, additional successes allow an extra success each to be up-kept.

Idea: Have overlapping groups for various concepts
ex.
Healing, Nurture, Birth themes all have some healing concepts but with various focuses.

Idea: Each power grants a passive ability to the character, potentially requiring a trait to unlock or some minimum skill level. Ex. Resist temperature grants passive damage reduction from temperature based spells? Might be too powerful or make mages to much better than non-mages.

Idea: Each theme has a Unique power, a couple full powers, and a partial power.
