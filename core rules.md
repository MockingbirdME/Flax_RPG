# Skill Checks
When a character may wishes to attempt an action where success is not certain and failure is not guaranteed, or when a characterâ€™s degree of success or failure matters, the GM may call for a skill check.

## Making a Skill Check
To perform a skill check requires a number of steps as follows:
1. Determine relevant attribute and skill.
2. Determine difficulty and required successes.
2. Determine (dis)advantage - a character gains disadvantage if they are not proficient in the relevant skill, gains advantage for each rank of proficiency beyond the first and may gain any number of either from situational benefits. If a character has both advantage and disadvantage they remove one of each until only one or the other is being added to the skill check.
3. Roll 2d10 + 1d10 for every level of (dis)advantage in the skill check.
4. Select two dice from the roll, the lowest two if the roll has disadvantage otherwise the highest two.
5. Add the character's relevant attribute's bonus/penalty to the sum of the two dice selected from the previous step.
6. Compare the total from step five to the difficulty of the skill check and determine results.

## Difficulties:
* 6-7 - very easy
* 8-10 - easy
* 11-12 - standard difficulty for most actions.
* 13-15 - difficult
* 16-17 - very difficult
* 18+ - Extremely difficult

## Skill Check Results
* 5 or more Less than difficulty - critical failure, not only does the action fail but something went wrong as determined by the GM.
* Less than difficulty - failure, the action simply fails but nothing else goes wrong.
* Equal to difficulty -  near success, the action was not a complete success but brought the character closer to success than they were before performing the action.
* Equal to difficulty plus required successes - complete success, the action is successful.
* Greater than difficulty plus required successes - the action gains an additional success for each point by which the result exceeds the difficulty.

If the skill check succeeds instead of inflicting damage the target's weapon (attacker's choice if wielding more than one) is knocked to the ground at their feet, each additional success may be used to knock the disarmed weapon an additional hex away from the target and 5 minus the character's rank in the *disarm secondary skill (melee combat)* additional successes may be spent to allow a character in the same hex as the weapon to ready it provided they have a free hand.

Cast one spell the caster knows by making a cast spell skill check with a difficulty based on the spell being cast, if the skill check is successful the character suffers arcane dues as detailed on the spell. This action's action point cost is determined by the spell's selected speed effect. If the spell has an action point cost of zero and a range of self it takes effect immediately, if it has an action point cost of zero and a range of manifest the caster may take a manifest spell action with an action point cost of zero as their next action this turn.

#### Free attack
When an opponent provokes a free attack the character may make a basic attack action, off handed attack action, loose/shoot/fire action, or a throw action with a ready, loaded when applicable, weapon or spell against that opponent. This reaction's stamina cost is that of the action taken.

## Combat Modifiers
Various conditions can affect a combat situation, changing the difficult to hit a target.

# Hits and Damage

## Suffering Damage
When a character suffers damage from some attack or effect follow the steps below.
1. Determine the type of damage being inflicted.
2. If damage type is penetrating and the total amount of damage is less than the character's *armor value* change the damage type to concussive.
3. Reduce the damage by the character's *resistance* for the specific type of damage.
4. If the character has the *weakness* trait for the damage type double the remaining damage.
4. If the remaining damage is greater than zero reduce and equal to or less than the character's *toughness*, reduce the damage to one.
5. Inflict the a number of wounds to the character equal to the remaining damage.

## Suffering From Damage
A character who has taken damage may suffers from the most penalizing of follow conditions that they qualify for.
* **Stunned -** if the character has suffered two or more wounds from one instance of damage since their last turn they suffer a minus one penalty to each of their skill checks.
* **Lightly Wounded -** if the character has suffered at least as many wounds as their *toughness* they suffer a minus one penalty to all of their skill checks.
* **Wounded -** if a character has suffered at least half their *max wounds* they gain disadvantage to each of their skill checks.
* **Badly Wounded -** if a character has suffered a number of wounds equal to their *max wounds* they suffer two levels of disadvantage to each of their skill checks.
* **Dying -** if a character has suffered more wounds than their *max wounds* they can not take actions or perform skill checks and they will soon die without medical attention.

## Armor and Weapons
### Armor
Suits of armor have a number of properties:

# Magic
Mages can wield and shape arcane energy in one of two ways, they can cast practiced spells and cantrips or they can draw upon raw arcane power to be shaped and molded by their will.

## Casting Methods
#### Crafting Effects
By first gathering arcane energy before shaping it as they desire a mage can make any effect they have the skill for, however doing so has additional risks as magic is as much art as science and the amount of power unleashed can be uncertain.
#### Spells
The most common and safest way for a mage to bend reality is by practicing specific effects until they become rote.
#### Cantrips
Cantrips are simple spells that the mage has worked with so many times they no longer require a skill check to cast and have a set stamina cost.

## Complicated Magic
#### Prolonged Arcane Manipulation
#### Group Arcane Manipulation

## Creating Spells and Cantrips
All spells start with a Stamina Cost of 0, an Arcane Pool of 0, and a Range of Touch. The spell is then developed by adding effects to the spell from amongst those the mage has access too. Each effect has an arcane cost associated with it, this cost is added to the spell's arcane pool.

## Arcane Effects
Many Arcane effects are available to all mages regardless of specialty or skill level others are associated with a specific Arcane Power. Arcane Powers are each associated with one or more Arcane Themes. For a mage to have access to the arcane effects of a specific arcane power they must have a mage trait that gives them access to effects from that power or one of its associated themes.

## Spell, Cantrip, and Crafted Effect Building
When building a spell, cantrip, or crafting an effect there are a number of steps to be followed:
  1. Select one range effect the caster has access to.
  2. Select one speed effect the caster has access to.
  3. Select one delay effect the caster has access to.
  4. Select one components effect the caster has access to.
  4. Select any number of other effects the caster has access to.
  5. Sum the arcane cost of all effects in the cantrip, spell, or crafted effect.
  6. For spells and crafted effects the total arcane cost, modified by any relevant traits or other abilities the character has, is the amount of arcane dues the character suffers. Cantrips do not inflict arcane dues.
  7. For spells the total arcane cost plus ???, modified by any relevant traits or other abilities the character has, is the spells difficulty to cast.

Arcane effects are listed in the following format:
- *Effect Name (Effect's Arcane Cost)*
  - Limitations: Extra limits on the use of the effect.
  - Theme(s): What arcane theme(s) this effect is linked to.
